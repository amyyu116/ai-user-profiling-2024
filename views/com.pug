    h3 No Personal Attacks and Bullying
    p Zero tolerance on this! Neighborhood is a place to to share our snaps and our love, not to tear each other down. 

    h3 No Racism, sexism, and other discrimination
    p Attacking entire classes of people is just like attacking a single person: we'll ban you for it.

    h3 No NSFW material
    p If you wouldn't show your boss, don't show it here! 

    h3 Review of Waiver of Consent 
    p (Insert review of study terms)
