The Neighborhood Simulation
=======================
This is the social media interactive for the "Spreading Awareness of AI in User Profiling" project conducted at the UnCoRe Cyber-AI REU Summer 2024. 

Software was developed using the Truman Platform 2023 codebase. We implemented a dynamic response system using LLM-generated responses to user activity and added additional synthetic content in the form of posts, profiles, and replies to diversify the post topics. A corresponding "topics" field in which the user can curate the feed has also been implemented to promote user activity. 

This project and repository has been forked and edited from the original [Truman Platform 2023 codebase](https://github.com/cornellsml/truman_2023).
